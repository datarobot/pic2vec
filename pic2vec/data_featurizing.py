"""
This file deals with featurizing the data once the featurizer has been built and the data has been
loaded and vectorized.

It allows users to featurize the data with model.predict. It also lets the featurizer write the
featurized data to the csv containing the images, appending the features to additional columns
in-line with each image row. Also adds "image_missing" columns automatically for each image_column
which contains binary values of whether the image in that row is missing.
