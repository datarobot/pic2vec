"""
This file deals with preprocessing the images for the featurizer.

It gives the user 3 options:
1. Upload a CSV with URL pointers.
2. Upload an image directory with no CSV. The featurizer will generate a CSV automatically.
3. Upload a CSV with an image directory. The CSV will contain pointers to image in the directory.

The integrated function is the preprocess_data function, which takes in the input and
generates a 4D tensor containing the vectorized representations of the image to be featurized.
